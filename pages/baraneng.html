    <h1>Paul Baran (1926. April 29-2011. March 26)</h1>
    <p>
        He was born in Grodno on April 29, 1926.His family moved to the United States on May 11, 1928, settling in Boston and later in Philadelphia.After joining the RAND Corporation in 1959, Baran took on the task of designing a "survivable" communications system that could maintain communication between end points in the face of damage from nuclear weapons during the Cold War.Then, most American military communications used high-frequency connections, which could be put out of action for many hours by a nuclear attack.

        After proving survivability, Baran and his team needed to show proof of concept for that design so that it could be built. That involved high-level schematics detailing the operation, construction, and cost of all the components required to construct a network that leveraged the new insight of redundant links.After the publication of On Distributed Communications, he presented the findings of his team to a number of audiences, including AT&T engineers not to be confused with Bell Labs engineers.In 1968, Baran was a founder of the Institute for the Future and was then involved in other networking technologies developed in Silicon Valley.In the early 1980s, Baran founded PacketCable, Inc, "to support impulse-pay television channels, locally generated videotex, and packetized voice transmission.Baran died in Palo Alto, California, at the age of 84 on March 26, 2011 from complications caused by lung cancer.

        Upon his death, RAND President James Thomson, stated, "Our world is a better place for the technologies Paul Baran invented and developed, and also because of his consistent concern with appropriate public policies for their use.One of the fathers of the Internet, Vinton Cerf, stated, "Paul wasn't afraid to go in directions counter to what everyone else thought was the right or only thing to do. According to Paul Saffo, Baran also believed that innovation was a "team process" and avoided seeking credit for himself.
