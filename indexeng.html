            History
        </h2>
        <p>
            The peculiarity of the Internet is that it provides global and open access to information for wide masses. So we can only talk about the Internet since the early to mid-1990s. The Internet was born with the explosion of HTTP and the World Wide Web and the spread of Internet service. Prior to this, the term "internet" was used in several ways as an abbreviation for "internet connection". It was with this meaning that the name IP (Internet Protocol) was included. This is also the colloquial name of the continuously, slowly expanding inter-institutional backbone network of closed or limited access overseas institutions that play a key role in network research. The history of the protocols currently used on the Internet goes back decades.

            Story
        </h2>
        <p>
            The roots go back to the 1960s, the story began with the percolation of military developments into the civilian sphere. At that time, the need for a low-vulnerability computer network arose in the USA, the remaining parts of which would remain functional after a possible nuclear attack. President Dwight D. Eisenhower ordered the establishment of DARPA (Defense Advanced Research Project Agency), which funded the research after the news of the launch of Sputnik 1 to counter the Soviets' success in the space race.

            In 1972, the first e-mail program was born. The term "Internet" appeared for the first time in 1974, in a study about the TCP protocol. In 1983, the military segment was separated from the previously strictly controlled ARPANET under the name MILNET (Military Network). 1988 was the year of the first network worm. The National Science Foundation recognized that the backbone network could be of crucial importance in scientific research, which is why it took a big role in expanding the Internet. In 1985–86, the NSF 6 supercomputer center was built, and the resulting network (named NSFNET) was connected to the ARPANET. The NSFNET (National Science Foundation Network) is still the dominant backbone network in the USA today after several expansions (optical cables were laid, new lines were created, as a result of which the speed of the network increased from the initial 56 kbps to 45 Mbps). ARPANET was formally discontinued in 1989 to give way to more advanced backbone networks. In addition to NSFNET, a significant part of communication already takes place on the networks of private companies.

            The Internet in Hungary

            Its domestic spread was accelerated when, in addition to the telephone modem available on the Matáv (now Magyar Telekom) network since 1995, the ISDN service for business and residential purposes began in 1999 thanks to the Matávnet subsidiary. In May 2001, changing to the name Axelero - and using that name until 2005 - it made the faster broadband ADSL technology introduced a year earlier available to private individuals. After the opening of the landline telecommunications market in December 2001, several service providers appeared with diverse offers.

            Research is currently underway to solve the technical (mainly telecommunications) problems of the Internet, for example the introduction of the new IPv6 addressing system. The currently used addressing system (IPv4) is running out of new, assignable addresses for endpoints (e.g. subscribers' computer(s) or other device(s), servers, etc.), which if the problem were to be solved (IPv6) and the solution before the completion of the transition on a global level, then the further expansion of the Internet would only be possible with great difficulty and great sacrifices.
